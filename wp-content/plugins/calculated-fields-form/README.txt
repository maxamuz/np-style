The CFF plugin allows you to create both simple and professional forms. Its form builder includes dynamic calculated fields and many other controls.

== Description ==

Absolutely! The "<a href="https://cff.dwbooster.com/download">Calculated Fields Form</a>" plugin opens up a world of possibilities. Here's a breakdown of what you can achieve:

**Financial Calculations**: Design forms that automatically compute totals, taxes, discounts, and other financial metrics.

**Booking Forms**: Seamlessly handle date operations, availability checks, and booking calculations.

**Product Pricing**: Dynamically calculate product prices based on user inputs or predefined rules.

**Math Operations**: Perform basic arithmetic, percentages, and complex mathematical functions.

**Text Processing**: Manipulate text fields, concatenate strings, and format data.

**Date Operations**: Handle date differences, age calculations, and time-related tasks.

Advanced Operations:

**Distance Calculations**: Compute distances between locations.

**Chart Generation**: Create charts dynamically based on form data.

**Third-Party Service Integration**: Call external APIs or services for real-time data retrieval.

And the best part? All resulting forms are **mobile responsive**, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

The most remarkable aspect is that you donâ€™t need to hire a developer to create forms. With basic knowledge, you can have professional forms in minutes.

The form builder is entirely visual, offering a wide selection of controls (Text fields, Numbers, Currency, Date/time, Slider control, Email, Radio buttons, Checkboxes, Container fields, Multi-page control, QR code reader, Recording, Calculated fields, and many others). This versatile toolkit empowers you to create customized forms effortlessly.

And its new AI assistant provides exceptional support for developing complex calculation formulas and designing custom forms with ease.

== Other Notes ==

= Equation / Formula format for calculated fields =

Below, some possible formulas are included as examples, but the possibilities are endless.

* With simple mathematical operations:

    `fieldname1 + fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 * fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 / fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 - fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 - fieldname2`

* With mathematical operations involving multiple fields and grouped fields:

    `fieldname1 * (fieldname2 + fieldname3)`

* With rounding operations. Round the result to two decimal places:

    `PREC(fieldname2 / fieldname3, 2)`

* There are infinite number of formulas that can be created using complex structures. For example, the following formula includes conditional statements:

    `(function () {`
    `if (100 < fieldname3) return fieldname1 + fieldname2;`
    `if (fieldname3 <= 100) return fieldname1 * fieldname2;`
    `})();`

* For complex formulas/equations you must use the function format with return statement to return the result to the calculated field:

     `(function () {`
        `var result = 0;`
        `/* Your code here */`
        `return result;`
    `}) ();`

= Operations and operators to use in equations/formulas =

One of the "Calculated Fields Form" strengths is the ability to use any valid JavaScript code to implement the equations/formulas.

However, the plugin includes a wide variety of operations and operators to simplify the development process.

[Mathematical Operations and Operators](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#mathematical-module)

[Conditional Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#conditions-module)

[Field Handling Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#managing-fields-module)

[Operations for interacting with external services](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#connection-module)

[Operations for handling URLs and query strings](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#url-module)

In addition to the operation modules listed above, the Developer and Platinum versions of the plugin include additional modules:

[Date Time Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#datetime-module)

[Financial Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#financial-module)

[Distance and Travel Time Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#distance-module)

[Operations to generate charts](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#chart-module)

= Create variables from parameters received by "GET" or "POST", "SESSION" variables, or "COOKIES" to use in the equations =

The plugin includes the shortcode [CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR] to generate JavaScript variables from parameters received by "GET" or "POST",  "SESSION" variables, or "COOKIES":

`[CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR name="..."]`

In the shortcode, you must replace the "..." symbols with the name of the parameter or variable. The variables are created as properties of the cff_var variable. For example, in the [CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR name="my_var"] shortcode, you can access the variable value from the equations by using cff_var['my_var'], or cff_var.my_var

For example:

`[CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR name="varname"]`

You can use the variables generated through the shortcode [CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR] in the formulas of the calculated fields: `fieldname1*cff_var.varname`

The complete list of parameters accepted by the variables shortcode is available at the following link: [CLICK HERE](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#javascript-variables)
