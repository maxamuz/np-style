= 1.2.53 =

* Improves the plugin security. Special thanks to Tiffany Tyson, Customer Support Engineer at WordFence. Pay attention to users who pass additional attributes through the form shortcode. In previous plugin versions, the attributes were converted as Javascript variables with global scope. For example, in shortcodes like [CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS id="1" custom_attr="234"], the plugin created the custom_attr variable with value 234, and you could use it directly in the equations as custom_attr*fieldname1. However, this feature hides a serious problem. You could overwrite global variables like window or document. The current plugin update generates the variable as a property of the cff_var object, and you should use it as cff_var['custom_attr'] or cff_var.custom_attr

The previous code example must be overwritten as cff_var['custom_attr']*fieldname1
